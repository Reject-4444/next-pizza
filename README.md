**Project Description:**

**next-pizza** is an interactive online platform designed for ordering pizza, drinks, and other products, leveraging modern web technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Prisma, and Vercel. The application allows users to browse an extensive product catalog, filter items by categories and ingredients, and manage their selection with a shopping cart feature. While the registration and checkout functionalities are still under development, the platform already offers a smooth browsing experience with real-time updates.

Built with Next.js, the application benefits from server-side rendering and static generation, ensuring fast load times and optimized performance. Tailwind CSS enables a flexible, responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. TypeScript enhances code reliability, ensuring type safety and reducing potential runtime errors.

For data management, Prisma is used to interact with the database, while Zustand efficiently handles global state management across the application. QS and Axios simplify query string parsing and API requests, respectively, and react-use provides utility hooks for enhanced user interactions. Additionally, the use of Radix UI and Lucide React ensures a clean, accessible interface with intuitive components.

The project is deployed on Vercel, enabling automated builds and easy scaling.
